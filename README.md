# tsnpcs - Software Testing related artwork.

All artwork is distributed under IDGaF license. It means that you can use provided designs for any noncommercial purposes like creation of handout materials for conferences and meet-ups, printing wall posters for home and office and so on, but if you violate the license I will most probably do nothing, because I don't give a fuck.

For custom requests please create an issue or send me an [email](mailto:jstpcs@ya.ru).
